# 7 Days To Die Backpack Mod

* Create a 'Mods' directory if it doesn't exist
* Clone this repository into the Mods folder
* Exit your current game (you can leave 7 days to die running) and re-enter your save

## Backpack

This adds two columns and one row to your backpack, giving you 72 inventory slots instead of 45.  The last 18 slots still need to be unlocked with mods or the Pack Mule perk to prevent encumberance if they're required.

Note: The last column is far enough to interfere with the forge input and output slots.  They are still accessible, you just need to find
the right area of the forge slot to use, the top-right I think.  Small price to pay for me...
